In Taiwan, YouBike (微笑單車 [link]) is synonymous with the public bicycle system. The system makes the movement pattern between urban and rural areas more flexible. In addition, the system has an open API for data acquisition and application. In this regard, our system (Bikeham) aims to convert data into information and improve decision-making quality. The system was born in April 2025, and we decided to start in Taichung City. If you have any suggestions or experiences, please let us know. Of course, we also need sponsorship and any support, if possible.

The system was developed by iAS Lab's PI (Dr. Lin, Shang-Chih).
